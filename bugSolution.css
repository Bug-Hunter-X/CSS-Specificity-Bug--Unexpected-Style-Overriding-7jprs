Several approaches can address the specificity problem. Here are two:

**1. Use `!important` (generally discouraged):**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.specific-class {
  color: red;
}

#specific-id {
  color: green;
}

#specific-id.specific-class {
  color: purple; /* This selector is problematic */
}

#specific-id {
  color: green !important; /* Forces green to override purple*/
}
```

While `!important` works, it's generally discouraged as it reduces predictability and maintainability. It's better to refactor the styles to avoid such conflicts in the first place.

**2. Refactor CSS (preferred):**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.specific-class {
  color: red;
}

#specific-id {
  color: green;
}

/* Avoid the problematic combined selector */
```

Refactoring ensures that the styles are applied predictably and without unexpected overrides.  This often requires careful consideration of CSS selectors and overall structure. For example we might introduce a new class or a new ID, so that the styles can be better separated.
